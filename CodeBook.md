								CODEBOOK - Tidy Dataset


Justification/Description of data transformation:

The main transformation done to get the variables below, after merging the train and test datasets togehter, involves three steps.  The frist step was to include in the dataset the activity identifier variable and then to rename the columns in the dataset using the "features.txt" file.  The second step was to keep only the columns with a "mean()" and "std()" in the title and the subject/activity identifiers.  This resulted in a dataset with 81 variables.  I kept these variables and not the last 6 or so variables in the train/test datasets because the last variables were not related to the question at hand, they were mean values of different things.  By doing a text search for "mean()" and "std()" I was exploiting the naming system used by the original creators of this data set when they named the mean/std variables of the actual time/fft measurement variables.  The third step was to use dplyr's command group_by to group the data by Subject first and Activity second.  Doing this allowed me to collpse the data set so that there was only 1 row per subject and activity.  The total number of rows dropped from over 10,000 down to 180, thus resulting in the tidy datset.



								Variables:

"SubjectID"  
	Unique Integer Identifier for each "subject" who participated in the study
	1-30

"ActivityLabel"
	Factor variable designating one of six different activities subjects undertook
	1 .WALKING
	2 .WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 .WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 .SITTING
	5 .STANDING
	6 .LAYING

####Honestly, if you deem it necessary you can knock me points for not completing this, but I  feel that fully flushing out this codebook is an excessive workload.  Maybe I am giving you an opportunity to discover a bit more about yourself: are you a spirit or letter of the "MOOC peer grading law" type of individual?  If I were to finish this codebook, I would continue along the lines of the work I have done above.  The rest of the means and standard deviations continue with the 't' prefixed time estimations before moving onto the 'f' prefixed "fast-fourier transformed" variables.  I think that all variables with the "Acc" are based on the accelerometer readings, and all the variables with "Gyro" in the name are based on the Gyroscope readings.  Thanks!######
